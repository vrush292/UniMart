UniMart is a web-based "Campus Marketplace" developed to solve the problem of unorganized buying and selling of resources within a college environment. Unlike public platforms like OLX or Quikr, UniMart is restricted to students of the institute (VJTI), creating a trusted and secure ecosystem.

The platform allows students to list used items such as engineering textbooks, drafters, scientific calculators, and electronics. Buyers can search for items by category and connect directly with sellers via WhatsApp integration, eliminating middlemen and commission fees. The system features secure user authentication with institute-specific registration to ensure that only verified students form the community.
